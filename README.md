# Note_Taker

## Background
- At the request of a small business owner, I want them to be able to write and save notes so that they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete. 

## Note Taking Targets
- When the Note Taker Application is open, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
- When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
- When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text
then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
- When the user clicks on the Save icon at the top of the page then the new note they have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
- When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then the note appears in the right-hand column.
- When the user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
